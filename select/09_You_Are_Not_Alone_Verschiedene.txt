Leaving a part of you fading way
Remember the shape of games we used to play
Hold on and hope, I won't let you shook
There is a place where we'll all be okay

Don't be afraid, your sorrows are dead
You are not alone

You don't need to run away from what you fear
Or all the scars that you left behind
If you were half-blinded though, I thought you'd shout
I'll lead you through them, I know where they grow

Don't be afraid, this is not the end
And you are not alone

The sand that spilled for us cut all the ropes
Those that have bound you, here they bring you in peace
Open your door, don't ask for more
I will help you to bring up the bright

Don't be afraid, this is not the end
And we are not alone

Hold on and hope, I won't let you choke
Don't be afraid, this is not the end
